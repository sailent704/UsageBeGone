# Project under refactoring
I'm currently working on an updated version with more features, including a GUI!

# UsageBeGone
UsageBeGone is a tool primarily targetted at anyone who's ever had problems with background programs randomly using too much CPU (like in the screenshot below).
![High CPU Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sailent704/UsageBeGone/master/highCPU.png)


It can keep track of an application's CPU usage and automatically suspend it, all without user interaction.
The application is currently in heavy development, so expect daily updates with new features.
This application is provided "as-is", and I am not responsible for any lost data.
