It can keep track of an application's CPU usage and automatically suspend it, all without user interaction.
The application is currently in heavy development, so expect daily updates with new features.
This application is provided "as-is", and I am not responsible for any lost data.

# Configuration
In order for the application to monitor a process, make a ``names.txt`` file in the same folder where the UsageBeGone executable is located.
This section is bound to be expanded as the current parser is only a placeholder.
